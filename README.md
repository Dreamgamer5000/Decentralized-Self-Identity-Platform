# Decentralized-Self-Identity-Platform
The Decentralized Self-Identity Platform provides a secure and tamper-proof solution for storing user data. By leveraging blockchain technology, the system minimizes the risk of identity fraud.
Users have full control over their personal information, allowing them to share it with other parties as they choose. The platform maintains a transparent record of when and with whom the data has been shared.
Additionally, the system ensures that no external entity can retain user data for extended periods without explicit user consent.
## Features
* highly encrypted storage of user data
* Monitoring and management of access to user data for external parties by the user
* decentralised storage of user data
## Requirements
* Nodejs
* metamask
* Javascricpt
* Web3
